    <Textbox description="To address the devastating impact of locust swarms, we have developed a prototype solution that leverages the biopesticide Metarhizium Acridum. This fungi-based pesticide targets locusts and grasshoppers specifically, without harming other animals or humans. Our solution involves a custom-designed pesticide-spraying device that can be attached to small airplanes, allowing for rapid and widespread application across large areas."/>

    <Titleanddescription title="Storyboard and Project Plan:" description="If we were to implement our solution into the real world, this is our plan:"/>
    <Number number="1" title="Design Phase:" description="Our initial phase involves designing a simple yet effective pesticide-spraying device. This includes a container for the pesticide, a system of tubes, nozzles, and pumps to ensure even distribution, and a control interface for the pilot." />
    <Number number="2" title="Prototyping:" description="We would build and test the device in controlled environments to ensure its effectiveness and reliability." />
    <Number number="3" title="Field Testing:" description="Small-scale field tests would be done to to refine the application process and measure the impact on locust populations." />
    <Number number="4" title="Full-Scale Implementation:" description="We would prepare for large-scale deployment, coordinating with local farmers and communities." />

    <Titleanddescription title="Task Management Techniques" description="Effective implementation of our solution requires clear task management:"/>
    <Number number="1" title="Community Engagement:" description="Communicate with farmers and local communities to obtain permission for spraying and explain the benefits of Metarhizium Acridum."/>
    <Number number="2" title="Preparation:" description="Equip small planes with the pesticide-spraying device, ensuring all components are securely installed and functioning."/>
    <Number number="3" title="Operation:" description="Trained pilots and ground correspondents work together to identify and target locust-infested areas, ensuring precise application of the pesticide."/>
    <Number number="4" title="Monitoring:" description="Regularly monitor the treated areas to assess the effectiveness of the pesticide and make any necessary adjustments."/>

    <Titleanddescription title="Rubric for Measuring Success" description="To ensure our project is on track and effective, we have established the following criteria for success:"/>
    <Number number="1" title="Effectiveness:" description="Measure the reduction in locust populations in treated areas compared to untreated areas."/>
    <Number number="2" title="Safety:" description="Monitor the impact on non-target species and ensure no adverse effects on humans and other wildlife."/>
    <Number number="3" title="Coverage:" description="Assess the area covered by the pesticide application and the efficiency of the spraying device."/>
    <Number number="4" title="Cost-Efficiency:" description="Evaluate the overall cost of implementation, aiming to minimize expenses while maximizing coverage."/>
    <Number number="5" title="Community Satisfaction:" description="Gather feedback from farmers, community members, and other sources to gauge satisfaction with the solution."/>

    <Titleanddescription title="Challenges and Best Practices" description="Implementing our solution comes with several challenges, including:"/>
    <Number number="1" title="Timelines:" description="Coordinating with multiple land owners and managing the logistics of equipping planes and conducting sprays in a timely manner"/>
    <Number number="2" title="Project Management:" description="Utilizing new principles of project management, including web storyboards, site maps, job duties, and time constraints, to ensure smooth execution."/>
    <Number number="3" title="Best Practices:" description="Adopting best practices for communication, community-interaction, and feedback to improve our solution."/>
